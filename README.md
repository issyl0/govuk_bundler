`govuk_bundler`
===============

This module manages the config used by bundler for access to gemstash.

This is extracted from https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/blob/master/modules/govuk_bundler to try making it standalone with Test Kitchens, InSpec and be able to be tested against Puppet 5 on Travis CI.
